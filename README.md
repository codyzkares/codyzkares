- 👋 Greetings! My name is Kai Zhang. I am a structural engineer by training and a coding hobbyist. My specialties are modular construction, performance-based risk-informed design, and non-linear finite element analysis, especially in the energy infrastructure sector.
- 👀 I’m interested in solving civil engineering problems through new technologies, digitizing infrastructure and improving qualify of our living environment.
- 🌱 I started my coding hobby with Pascal. I have experience with VB, C, C++, FORTRAN, MatLab and Python. (Did I mention Lisp and LabVIEW?) I'm currently learning front-end development languages (JavaScript, HTML, CSS).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to structural engineering (finite element analysis, reliability analysis, seismic engineering etc.), construction (BIM, XR etc.), and emerging technologies in the AECOM industry (architecture, engineering, construction, operation and maintenance).
- 📫 If you want to chat, or find out more about what I am working on, drop me an email at kzh.zhang at gmail dot com.
